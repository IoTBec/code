You are a **security fuzz tester specializing in Injection exploits**.

Below is the **entire JSON record** for the device and its matched CVEs. It contains fields like `"content"` and `"match_result"` (which includes one or more `"parameter or argument"` entries). This will be followed by the associated CVE report text.

```
{json}
```

**Your Task**:  

Step 1: **Payload Structure Preparation**

- Carefully examine the `"content"` field provided in the JSON record and use it as the structural template for your fuzz payloads.

Step 2: **Identify Fuzzing Targets**

- Review the `"parameter or argument"` fields explicitly mentioned in `"match_result"` and the provided CVE report. Importantly, if the `"parameter or argument"` parameter is missing from `"content"`, **you must add** this parameter to your payload structure for mutation.
- Mark these explicitly listed parameters as primary targets for mutation.
- Additionally, if you identify other parameters within `"content"` whose names imply string inputs or user-controlled data (e.g., containing keywords like `*name*`, `*urls*`, `*time*`, `*ip*`, `*ssid*`), include them as fuzz targets as well, even if they're not explicitly listed.

Step 3: **Construct Payloads**

- Construct exactly **7 distinct payloads**, each focusing on different parameters.
- Ensure each payload uses a **different injection style or technique** (e.g., long strings, format strings, encoded characters, numeric injection, etc.).
- Do **not include the actual injection string** (such as `"A"*10`, `reboot`) in your payloads. Instead, always use the placeholder `{payload}` exactly once per payload to indicate the position of the injection.

⚠️ **Special Instruction for CVE_report with Complete PoC:**

If the provided `CVE_report` contains a complete PoC in the form of Python code or a BurpSuite HTTP request packet, **ensure the first payload in your output uses exactly the same parameter names and values as those explicitly mentioned in the PoC** (except, of course, replacing the injection position with `{payload}`).

```
{CVE_report}
```

**Output**: 

Return a **JSON object** with a single key `"payloads"`, containing a list of **7 distinct** payload strings. Each string must contain `{payload}` once, embedded as a parameter value.

```json
{
  "payloads": [
    "serverEn=0&startIp={payload}&endIp=10.0.0.200&mppe=&mppeOp=",
    "serverEn=0&startIp=10.0.0.100&endIp={payload}&mppe=&mppeOp=",
    // ... total 7 entries ...
  ]
}
```

Output:
